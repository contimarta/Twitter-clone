Twitter Clone (Chitter) App 
=================

### How to run the App:
0. Go to https://glittering-starship-2d6852.netlify.app/ and start peeping!ðŸš€ I have deployed the backend using Render, with the deployed API URL: https://my-chitter-app.onrender.com . I've then used Netlify to deploy the frontend of the application.

The Chitter repository is divided into two main folders: backend and frontend. 

1. In each folder, you need to run the `npm install` command. 
2. To start the Express Server in the backend, you need to run the `npm start` command. Make sure your terminal is in the backend folder. The MongoDB database is stored in the cloud using a MongoDB Atlas cluster. The application is connected to the cluster through a connection string, so you do not need to install MongoDB.
3. To start the React App in the frontend, you need to run the `npm start` command. Make sure your terminal is in the frontend folder.
4. Both in frontend and backend, you can run `npm test` command. The backend tests have been done with Mocha, Chai, and Chai-http. The frontend tests have been done with React Testing Libraries and Jest. Unfortunately, there are some act warnings that I have not been able to handle. The Front End has 45 passing tests, and the Back End has 6 passing tests.
5. .env variables have been added to both the frontend and backend to run the tests, deployment and the development in different URLs (in deployment the backend API is hosted by Render). The back end tests are done in the chitter-test database instead of ChitterDB, so that they are done in a controlled environment.

### Wireframe and Components Hierarchy:

Follow the colors to know the position of each component in the hierarchy.

### Back End routes and services:

Each route is linked to a react component in the Front End.

- `"/peeps"` routes: 
    1. `post("/", auth, createPeep)`: if the user is logged in this route creates a new Peep with the text typed by the user. React component: **NewPeep**.
    2. `get("/", getPeeps)`: it gets all the peeps. React component: **PeepList**.
    3. `post("/comment", auth, createComment)`: if the user is logged in, it creates a new Comment with the text typed by the user. React component: **NewComment**.

- `"/users"` routes:
    1. `post("/register", signupValidator, registerUser)`: if the user has introduced their details correctly, it creates a new User. React component: **SignUp**.
    2. `post("/login", loginUser)`: if the user has introduced their details correctly, it validates them and stores a token in localStorage. React component: **LogIn**.
